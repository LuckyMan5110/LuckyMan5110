 Hi there! 👋
I'm Oleksii. I work as a full-time software engineer. In my spare time I do open-sourcing (normally it is about 1-2 hours in the morning before the work). Most of my open-source projects below  are focused on one thing - to help people learn . You may use these projects to learn about algorithms in JavaScript and get prepared for technical interviews, or to learn Python syntax and start experimenting with machine learning algorithms and math behind them, etc. I also write articles about life, web-development and machine learning.
